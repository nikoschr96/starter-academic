I'm Nick, I am an Electrical and Computer Engineer. I graduated from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in August 2020 with a 7.25/10 GPA. My interests include Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Systems Administration. Besides CS, I really like cycling and reading about psychology and philosophy (especially Stoicism).
